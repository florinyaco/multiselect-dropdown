# Dropdown select list

## Welcome

Thank you for taking the time to work on our coding challenge. It is a small frontend task where we would like
you to create a dropdown with a select list for the data provided in the repository.
Our suggestion is to spend maximum 30-40 min on the task.

## Setup

- It is up to you how you want to solve the task, but the solution should be able to run on any machine.
- You can use a JS framework, or if you wish, you can go vanilla. It can be written in TypeScript or Javascript, you are free to choose.
- It is okay if you want to host it somewhere, or have us run it locally.
- We hope to receive the git repository back with your solution committed to it.
- Comments to the code are welcomed.

## Task

- There is an array of metadata in the metadata.const.js.
- Create a dropdown select list for it that supports both single and multi select scenarios.
- It is possible to inspect the selection, either print it out or show it in another creative way. Let us know :)
